Arduino Daemulanove has only one Analog to Digital Converter . So, it's difficult to read two adc values simultaneously. So, for each run of the loop ,
we switch between channels to read adc values of x axis and y axis (when interfacing it with an accelerometer) . This can be extended to all the 
available 6 channels of the arduino daemulanove.
